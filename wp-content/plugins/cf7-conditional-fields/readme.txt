Adds conditional logic to Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

This plugin adds conditional logic to [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/).

If you edit your CF7 form, you will see an additional tag called "Conditional fields Group". Everything you put between the start and end tag will be hidden by default.
After you added the field group(s), you should click Save.
Then you should go to the "Conditional fields" tab to create one or more conditions that will make the group(s) appear.

= What's new? =

* Required fields can be used inside hidden groups without causing validation problems.

* Added support for nested groups in email
* Tested on WP version 4.7.2 with Contact Form 7 version 4.6.1

(https://wordpress.org/support/topic/activation-issue-5/ and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/http-500-unable-to-handle-request-error-after-update/)
* Fixed some PHP notices (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/undefined-index-error-in-ajax-response/)
* Attempted to fix error with the CF7 success page redirects plugin (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/warning-invalid-argument-error-for-forms-without-conditional-fields/)

= 0.2.7 =
* Added support for conditional fields in the email (2) field
* Got rid of some PHP warnings
* Saving a form only once, directly after adding or removing conditions, caused conditional logic not to work. This is fixed now. Thanks to @cpaprotna for pointing me in the right direction. (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-more-than-3-conditional-statements/)
* Fix validation error with hidden checkbox groups (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hidden-group-required-field-is-showing-error/)

* WP 4.7 broke the required conditional fields inside hidden groups, implemented in version 0.2. Thanks again to @stevish for pointing this out.

* Prevent strict standards notice to appear while adding new group via the "Conditional Fields Group" popup.
* Only load cf7cf admin styles and scripts on cf7 pages.

* Bug fix: arrow kept spinning after submitting a form without conditional fields. (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/version-0-2-gives-a-continues-spinning-arrow-after-submitting/)
