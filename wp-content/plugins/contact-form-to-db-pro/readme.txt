== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I download a file which is attached to the letter? =

Two ways:

1. You can click on the sender's name to slide down the message's content, point to the file name and click on the "Download" link that appears.
2. Also you can mark the checkbox near the sender's name, chose "Download attachments" from the dropdown menu at the top or at the bottom of the list of messages and click "Apply" button.

= Why are the files with ".tiff" extension not displayed in the browser? =

Browsers do not display images with ".tiff" extension.
To view these images the plugin converts ".tiff" to ".jpeg" into small thumbnails. But it does not work on all servers.

= In what formats can messages be saved? =

You can save messages in "csv", "xml" and "eml" formats.

= Why does Contact Form to DB Pro pugin not work without Contact Form plugin? =

This plugin was created especially as an extension for Contact Form plugin.
It can receive messages ONLY from Contact Form plugin.
